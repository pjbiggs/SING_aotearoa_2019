# Bioinformatics practical for 2019 SING-Aotearoa session

This is taking place on Wednesday 23rd January 2019 in C5-10, Science Tower C, Massey University, Palmerston North

## Overview of the session

We are planning on covering the following in our 90 minute session:

* Mapping
    * Fastq format
    * SAM/BAM files
    * Visualisation of mapping
    * What did we learn?
* Assembly
    * Brief theory
    * Attempt with these reads (or a subset) – tbd 
    * What did we learn?


## Mapping of reads to a reference genome

### Fastq format



### SAM/BAM files



### Visualisation of mapping



### What did we learn?



## Assembling a small genome 




### Brief theory


### Attempt with these reads (or a subset) – tbd 



### What did we learn?








So, let's get going in R:

`library(ggplot2)`
